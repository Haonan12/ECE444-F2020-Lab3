## Activity 3: The difference between SQL or NoSQL database.

SQL
1. RDBMS or Relational Databases
2. SQL databases are vertically scalable
3. SQL databases are table based databases
4. SQL databases have a predefined schema
5. Structured query language

NoSQL
1. Non-relational or distributed database
2. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
3. NoSQL databases can be document based, key-value pairs, graph databases
4. NoSQL databases use dynamic schema for unstructured data.
5. No declarative query language
